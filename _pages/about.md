I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Information Engineering at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/main.htm) (SCUT), Guangzhou, China. My supervisor is  [Prof. Lianwen Jin](http://www.hcii-lab.net/lianwen/). Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from SCUT in 2015. Since my second year of Ph.D. study, I have been taking an internship in the [speech group of Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/speech/) supervised by Researcher [Qiang Huo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/qianghuo/) and [Lei Sun](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lsun/) and working on the MSRA OCR projects. I am the co-contributor of the industry-leading [Microsoft's new-generation Printed and Handwritten OCR API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/?from=timeline&isappinstalled=0#text), which is deployed in [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/).


My research interests include machine learning, pattern recognition, character recognition, text detection and recognition in natural scene images, layout analysis, and text-centric image understanding.
